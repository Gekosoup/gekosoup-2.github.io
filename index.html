      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>My name is <em>Maya Taylor</em> and I am a twenty two year old student living in Ottawa, Ontario!
        I have some experience with coding and graphic design from a previous program in Algonquin! 
        I’ve worked as a teachers assistant for a web design class in Algonquin and have done a few graphic design projects for local Ottawa businesses. 
        I also have experience as an artist vendor. This has taught me how to create printed products from digital art in various forms (prints, stickers, apparel). 
      </p>
      
      <p>I love video games, skateboarding and art! I have always held a passion for the digital world and art since I was young and I've always known that I wanted to find a field to apply those passions in a professional way!      .
        I work at a sushi restaurant called <i>Paradise Poké</i>! I also love to cook and bake as well!
        My favourite video games are Red Dead Redemption 2 and Detroit: Become human!
        The graphic styles of the games heavily inspire my digital art!
      </p>
